This machine learning project focuses on analyzing and modeling data from a CSV file using a structured pipeline. The key steps include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

Performed initial data inspection, summary statistics, and visualizations to understand the distribution, trends, and relationships between variables.

Data Preprocessing: 

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features where necessary.

Feature Engineering: 

Created new meaningful features to enhance model performance, such as transforming continuous variables into categorical bins and generating interaction terms.

Feature Extraction & Selection:

Chi-Square Test: Applied the chiÂ² test to assess the statistical significance of categorical features about the target variable.

Pearson Correlation: Also evaluated numerical features based on their correlation with the target to identify and retain the most informative features.
